# Mejillon Distortion Plus


## About

This is an LM358 OpAmp based guitar distortion FX inside a mussel can with high 
gain and a shiny industrial metal sound.


## Make it!

### The can

First of all, yo have to be hungry, get yourself a mussel can and some bread in
order to get that can empty.

Then, using a steel scourer, clean all the paint in the can until you get a 
shiny metal finish. Clean it with water and soap and let it dry.

All resistors will be 1/4W or 1/8W

Get some soldering prototyping board to put all components together.

Electronic board inside the can. I use some cotton to isolate the board from 
other metal parts.

Remmember to isolate power DC Jack from the can!! The standard in guitar FX 
pedals power supplies is: internal terminal negative; and external (what is in 
contact with the can) positive!! Our can will be connected to GND to avoid noise 
by input and output connectors, so if power jack is not isolated from the can it 
will produce a short circuit of the power supply. I use various layers of 
isolating tape.

To close the can I cut a piece of wood in a circular shape and fixed it to the 
can with isolating tape.
